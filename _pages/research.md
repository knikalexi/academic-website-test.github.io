## Job Market Paper

[**Ports and Power**](/files/KNikalexi_JMP.pdf) (2025)

Can foreign state actors reshape the map of European trade?  
This paper investigates the impact of Chinese state-led port investments on the subnational trade network within Europe, leveraging the staggered acquisition of stakes in 20 European ports and using 1.6 million truck-level quarterly shipments across 338 NUTS2 regions (2011–2022). I employ a shift–share event-study framework and exploit pre-investment trade dependence on port regions and their network-mediated links to estimate exposure to investment shocks.

[**Monetary Policy and Regional Inequality**](/files/Nikalexi_RegionalInequality.pdf),  
with de Groot, Hauptmeier, Holm-Hadulla. ECB Working Paper 2385. R&R at *The Economic Journal*.  

We study the impact of monetary policy on regional inequality using granular data on economic activity at the city- and county-level in Europe. We document pronounced heterogeneity in the regional patterns of monetary policy transmission. The output response to monetary policy shocks is stronger and more persistent in poorer regions, with the difference becoming particularly pronounced in the tails of the distribution. Regions in the lower parts of the distribution exhibit hysteresis, consisting of long-lived adjustments in employment and labor productivity in response to the shocks. As a consequence, policy tightening aggravates regional inequality and policy easing mitigates it. Finally, we provide a structural interpretation of our results using a New Keynesian Currency Union Model with hysteresis effects.

[**The Globalization of Corporate Control**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2023.103794),  
with Fonseca and Papaioannou. *Journal of International Economics*, Vol. 146, 2023.  

The internationalization of corporate control is a complex and poorly understood aspect of globalization, as it is challenging to trace controlling shareholders due to often opaque structures of ownership. We identify controlling shareholders for 22,000 listed firms to study the globalization of control. The network of international control appears very sparse, with strong home bias. A baseline gravity structure works well, as bilateral links are more potent for populous, affluent, and proximate countries. Institutions and tax haven status at source and destination play a modest role. Legal similarities, economic policy coordination, and cultural, linguistic, and historical ties play a non-negligible role. Policy and legal similarities matter for financial institutions and banks, while informational/cultural barriers matter more for individuals/families. International diversification motives play no major role. The results have implications for theoretical works on the internationalization of corporate control markets.
